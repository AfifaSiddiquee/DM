        ### ðŸ©º What Does This App Do?
        The Heart Disease Prediction App combines technology and health data to estimate your potential risk of heart disease. By inputting key details like your blood pressure, cholesterol, and exercise habits, the app analyzes these factors using an intelligent machine learning model trained on medical datasets. It delivers quick, personalized predictions â€” giving you a clearer understanding of how your lifestyle and health indicators contribute to heart disease risk. This empowers you to take preventative action, adjust unhealthy habits, and discuss the results with a healthcare professional to pursue the best course of action for a healthier future.

        ### Essential Capabilities
        - **Risk Assessment**: AI-powered heart disease prediction.
        - **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified design for easy input.
        - **Quick Results**: Instant prediction within seconds.
        - **Health Awareness**: Encourages understanding of heart disease risk factors.
        
        ### Understanding the Features
        Each input in the prediction form has a specific medical significance:
        - **Age**: Heart disease risk increases with age.
        - **Sex**: Men are generally at higher risk earlier in life; women's risk rises after menopause.
        - **Chest Pain Type (CP)**: 
          - 0: Typical Angina â€” Chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart.
          - 1: Atypical Angina â€” Chest pain that doesnâ€™t fit the classic pattern.
          - 2: Non-anginal Pain â€” Pain unrelated to the heart.
          - 3: Asymptomatic â€” No chest pain.
        - **Resting Blood Pressure (Trestbps)**: High blood pressure can overwork the heart.
        - **Cholesterol Level (Chol)**: High cholesterol leads to plaque buildup in arteries.
        - **Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS)**: > 120 mg/dl indicates possible diabetes, increasing heart risk.
        - **Resting Electrocardiographic Results (Restecg)**: Measures heart's electrical activity.
          - 0: Normal
          - 1: ST-T wave abnormality (possible heart problem)
          - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy (thickened heart muscle)
        - **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (Thalach)**: Lower rates might indicate heart issues.
        - **Exercise Induced Angina (Exang)**: Chest pain triggered by exercise.
        - **ST Depression (Oldpeak)**: Indicates heart stress during exercise.
        - **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (Slope)**:
          - 0: Upsloping â€” Better heart health.
          - 1: Flat â€” Higher risk.
          - 2: Downsloping â€” Potential heart disease.
        - **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (CA)**: More blocked vessels indicate higher risk.
        - **Thalassemia (Thal)**:
          - 0: Normal blood flow.
          - 1: Fixed defect â€” Permanent damage.
          - 2: Reversible defect â€” Blood flow can improve.

        This breakdown helps you understand how each feature affects heart disease prediction â€” empowering you to take control of your heart health.
